## Project Title
**InheritX** ‚Äî A secure and decentralized platform for creating and executing digital wills on the blockchain.

---

## Project Description
**InheritX** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the blockchain that transforms the traditional process of inheritance. By leveraging smart contracts, InheritX provides a secure, transparent, and immutable way to manage and transfer digital assets as part of a last will and testament.

This platform addresses the limitations of conventional will systems, which can be slow, costly, and prone to disputes. With InheritX, users can create a digital will, define beneficiaries, and specify the assets to be transferred. The execution of the will is automated by the smart contract under predefined conditions, ensuring that the creator's wishes are carried out without the need for intermediaries.

---

## Project Vision
Our vision is to modernize the process of inheritance for the digital age. We aim to provide a trustworthy and accessible platform where individuals can manage their digital legacy with confidence and ease. By using blockchain technology, we want to eliminate ambiguity, reduce legal complexities, and ensure a seamless transfer of assets to the rightful heirs, making the process of inheritance more efficient and secure for everyone.
