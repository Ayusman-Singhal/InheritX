## Project Title
**InheritX** ‚Äî A secure and decentralized platform for creating and executing digital wills on the blockchain.

---

## Project Description
**InheritX** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the blockchain that transforms the traditional process of inheritance. By leveraging smart contracts, InheritX provides a secure, transparent, and immutable way to manage and transfer digital assets as part of a last will and testament.

This platform addresses the limitations of conventional will systems, which can be slow, costly, and prone to disputes. With InheritX, users can create a digital will, define beneficiaries, and specify the assets to be transferred. The execution of the will is automated by the smart contract under predefined conditions, ensuring that the creator's wishes are carried out without the need for intermediaries.

---

## Project Vision
Our vision is to modernize the process of inheritance for the digital age. We aim to provide a trustworthy and accessible platform where individuals can manage their digital legacy with confidence and ease. By using blockchain technology, we want to eliminate ambiguity, reduce legal complexities, and ensure a seamless transfer of assets to the rightful heirs, making the process of inheritance more efficient and secure for everyone.

## Key Features

### Digital Will Creation  
Users can easily create a legally-binding digital will, specifying beneficiaries and asset distribution.

### Secure Asset Management  
Assets are securely managed by the smart contract, preventing unauthorized access or tampering. Testators can deposit and withdraw funds as needed before execution.

### Automated Execution  
The will is automatically executed by the smart contract upon verification of the creator's passing, ensuring timely distribution of assets.

### Beneficiary Management  
Creators can add, update, or remove beneficiaries and their allocated assets at any time.

### Executor Assignment  
Testators can assign and change executors who are responsible for confirming execution conditions and triggering the distribution of assets.

### Will Lifecycle Control  
Testators maintain full control over their wills with the ability to deactivate them if circumstances change.

### On-Chain Transparency & Security  
All transactions and will details are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and immutable record that builds trust and prevents disputes.

### Decentralized Control
Users have full control over their digital wills without relying on traditional financial or legal institutions.
